# 🪐 Spacefield Transformation: A First-Principles Derivation of the Universal Matter Mass, Confinement Radius, and Present-Epoch Cosmology

---

## 🧠 Overview
This repository contains the full LaTeX source, figures, and references for **Paper 1** of the *Spacefield Transformation (SFT)* research series.  
The paper establishes the **cosmological foundations of SFT** — a closed, parameter-free cosmology derived entirely from the **Universal Confinement Zone (UCZ)** postulate.

SFT predicts the observed Hubble constant, vacuum-energy density, and total cosmic mass purely from geometric closure conditions — without parameter fitting or empirical tuning.

## 🔬 Abstract
> The **Spacefield Transformation (SFT)** reformulates cosmology as a geometric closure law linking the total matter rest mass, curvature radius, and vacuum impedance of the Universe.  
> By enforcing a fixed boundary condition — the **Universal Confinement Zone (UCZ)** — the Hubble constant and vacuum-energy density emerge algebraically from first principles.  
> SFT resolves the *Hubble tension* and *cosmological-constant problem* within a unified geometric framework, predicting measurable deviations from ΛCDM in luminosity distances and gravitational-wave propagation.
